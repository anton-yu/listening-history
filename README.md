# Listening History Spotify Playlist

This application uses your last.fm scrobbles across music services (Hype Machine, Soundcloud, etc.) to create a Spotify playlist of your recent listening history (default last 50 tracks, limited to songs available on Spotify).

## Acknowledgement
This was meant as a simple project to become more familiar with Javascript and making API requests using Javascript. As such, it was made with significant help from Spotify's user guide and their example application playlist creator (https://github.com/possan/playlistcreator-example).
